## 🧠 The Unified Thesis: $B = E/S$

The **CCTU-1** project proposes a break from the Von Neumann architecture and traditional binary logic. Based on the observation of topological patterns in nature (such as molecular ice and graphene), we postulate that efficient computing does not depend on raw power, but on **lower Geometric Entropy**.

### The Flow Equation:
$$B = \frac{E}{S}$$

* **B (Bitrate/Flow):** The rendering rate of reality/information.
* **E (Energy/Mass):** The fuel for processing.
* **S (Entropy/Latency):** The informational cost that generates "lag" and mesh deformation.



## ❄️ What is the CCTU-1 Time Crystal?
Unlike silicon processors that struggle against heat (Entropy), CCTU-1 utilizes **Balanced Ternary Logic (-1, 0, +1)** operating within a hexagonal mesh.

In this architecture, processing occurs via **Sum of Tones**: information is not merely "on or off"; it flows through phase states, allowing the geometry of the mesh to dictate the calculation speed.

## 🛠️ What’s in this Repository?
1. **Real-time Simulators (HTML/Canvas):** Wave propagation tests on hexagonal meshes.
2. **Zero X Manifesto:** The philosophy behind the decentralization of computing.
3. **Research Logs:** Reflections on Bio-Topology and Time Crystals.

## 🔓 Why Open Source?
Information control through closed silos (Big Tech) generates an "Informational Gravity" that slows human evolution. By opening CCTU-1, we distribute the processing. No one can own a law of nature.
